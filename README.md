# Getting Started with Create React App

simple React config boilerplate

<br>

- [x] js bundler
- [x] plugin
  - [x] es and style lint
  - [x] webpackServer and config

## Available Scripts

1. rewrite the package.json file to reflect your project/ or do a clean installation by removing package.json but you have to keep in mind the dependencies and scripts

```
npm init -y
```

2. install the modules

```
cd yourFoldername/ && npm i
```

<hr>
In the project directory, you can run:

```
npm start
```

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.ormation.

```
npm run eject
```

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

```
npm run build
```

cheers :)
